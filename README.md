### Windows Explorer tools

Two scripts I made to automate repetitive workflow tasks.

#### 1. CopyFilesFromFolders
Copies and renames files from multiple folders. Useful for compiling multiple documents, such as photos placed into folders sorted by date. First prompts the user to select the parent folder.


#### 2. CreateFolders
Creates a list of sequentially named folders with a custom suffix in a directory. First prompts the user to select the directory and input the custom suffix. Useful when a large number of folders need to be created, e.g. for organisation of photos.
